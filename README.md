# particle-swarm-algorithm-stochastic-MATLAB
The repository contains an inertial weighted particle swarm optimization algorithm that implements the swarming principles seen in bird flocks and fish schools stochastically to arrive at a swarm configuration that settles at the true minimum of a function with 10e6 local minima.

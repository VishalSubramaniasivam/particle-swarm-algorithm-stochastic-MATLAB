# particle-swarm-algorithm-stochastic-MATLAB
The repository contains an inertial weighted particle swarm optimization algorithm that implements the swarming principles seen in bird flocks and fish schools stochastically to arrive at a swarm configuration that settles at the true minimum of a function with 10e6 local minima.

## General information
The availabe files need a MATLAB environment to compile.

## Primary MATLAB files
runPSO.m<br /><br />
This file will run the particle swarm optimization algorithm till the code converges to the true minimum of the algebric function.

## Remaining functions
The description for the remaining functions are commented in the respective files.
